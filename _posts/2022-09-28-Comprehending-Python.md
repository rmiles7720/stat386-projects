description: The different kinds of list comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions you can use to bypass for loops can be a little complicated, and I literally love doing anything that doesn't involve for loops, so lets see if we can't figure it out!

Any student who has learned the coding language for R and Rstudio has heard: Do not use loops! They're not worth it! As a dutiful student who was blissfully unaware of how other programming language worked, I took this direction quite literally. Any time I didn't have to use a for loop was a success. Unfortunately after becoming familiar with C++, SAS, python, and Linux, I realized that this approach was not sustainable. These different languages thrive on using for loops to generate and populate objects. Without a for loop, you really can't do much coding at all. The coding it would take to add things by hand isn't worth it, trust me, so I resigned myself to learn for loops.

Once learning python however, I realized that there are alternatives to using loops. I'm specifically referring to list and dictionary comprehensions. List and dictionary comprehensions work similarly to for loops, just in a different form. They also save the step of intialize and empty list or dictionary, which is always a plus. Anything to write less code, am I right?
