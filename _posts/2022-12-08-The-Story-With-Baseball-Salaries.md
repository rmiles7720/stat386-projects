Data can tell many stories. There's so much information one dataset has, it can be difficult to explain results in a clear and concise way. There's so much to try and process, and like all good stories, there's a lot of time, effort, and editing that goes into it. 

The data story I will be telling today is that of how MLB Players' salaries relate to the position they play. Is there a significant relationship between the two? 

Good Question, I want to know too!
