Have you ever wondered how much Pro Baseball Players get paid? Have you ever wondered if what position has effected how much make? Or how old they are? Or how long they've been in the league? 

Well I have. This is an Exploratory Data Analysis of data for every Active Player in the MLB in 2022. The data was taken from spotrac.com, a website which compiles professional athletes salaries and stats. You can find a brief overview of both how I got this data here and the dataset itself in this github repository. We can look at the data through the use of data visualizations to determine if any of those factors are worth a deeper look. This explortory data analysis will be a precursor to a statistical analysis to determine if any of the factors above are statistically significant.

## Let's look at the data!

Since a large amount of this data is categorical (by design), we have to get a little creative with how we view the data so we can understand it properly. 

### Age and Salary



### Position and Salary


### Status and Salary
