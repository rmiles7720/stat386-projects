I'm a current student in the Statistics Program at BYU. I'm not a Data Science emphasis, but I do enjoy learning about Data Science and Data Engineering. I also enjoy data analysis on sports, politics, social media analytics and more! Since I've had my fair share of troubles over how to code and wrangle data, I hope to blog about my experiences to help another struggling stats student. We're all in this together!
